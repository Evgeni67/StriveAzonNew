    Students Portfolio Repo
    
    You are in charge of creating a Student Portfolio Repo for both Frontend and Backend.
    In this last "step" the application should enable file upload & reviews.
    A review could be posted by a user to whatever project he likes.
    A review is defined by:
    - projectID
    - name
    - text
    - date
    
    //BACKEND
    You are in charge of building the Backend using NodeJS + Express. The backend should include the extra following routes:
    POST /students/id/uploadPhoto =>
     uploads a picture 
     (save as idOfTheStudent.jpg in the public/img/students folder)
      for the student specified by the id. Add a field on the students model called image, in where you store the newly created URL (http://localhost:3000/img/students/idOfTheStudent.jpg)
    POST /projects/id/uploadPhoto => 
    uploads a picture 
    (save as idOfTheProject.jpg in the public/img/projects folder) 
    for the project specified by the id. Add a field on the project model called image, in where you store the newly created URL (http://localhost:3000/img/projects/idOfTheProject.jpg)
    
    Configure Express to use the public folder to serve static files
    
    
    GET /projects => returns the list of projects
    GET /projects/id => returns a single project
    POST /projects => create a new project (Add an extra property NumberOfProjects on student and update it every time a new project is created)
    PUT /projects/id => edit the project with the given id
    DELETE /projects/id => delete the project with the given id
    
    GET /projects/id/reviews => get all the reviews for a given project
    POST /projects/id/reviews => add a new review for the given project
    [EXTRA] Edit & Delete
    
    //FRONTEND (extra)
    You are in charge of building the Frontend too. Use ReactJS to create an application for managing the students.
    Add the following features for the application
    - The user should be able to upload a picture for any given student
    - The user should be able to upload a picture for any given project
    - Create a component Avatar with picture and Name of the student. Use it on students' listing.
    - Change the Project Component to show the picture uploaded and the Reviews
